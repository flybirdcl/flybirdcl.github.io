# Summarizing articles from news 
By now, you should have a good idea of your project's motivations, scope, and potential results. Thus, you will now start filling in portions that will become your final report. For now, you only need to complete a rough draft of the introduction and related works sections (or combine them into a single narrative, whichever you find easier to write).

Create a new web-page with the following.

Copy over and then fill in your introduction outline and either weave-in the related works descriptions or create a new related works section. You will need to keep a references section at the end of the document (here is an example).
Write 400 to 800 words total (roughly one to two pages).
The key idea for the related works section is that it should be easy to read. It will no longer be a set of disjoint paragraphs. You should group together similar related studies and add transition sentences.

You will submit a link to your web-page on gradescope.

All of the information you provide is tentative, and I expect many groups to change their minds as projects evolve.


## Introduction

The outline must include this information:

An (optionally revised) project name and project scope
A list of three to five group members
A five to ten sentence outline
You may follow Dr. Stirewalt’s guidelines for writing an introduction (see below), but it is not mandatory.
You should not “fill-in” each paragraph; you should only provide the first sentence of each paragraph.
You should explain your ideal/expected results for the “details” and “assessment” paragraphs.
An ethical sweep (see below)

## Methods

You should now have a good idea of how you will complete your project. Add a “methods” section to your report web-page, which already includes a draft of your introduction and related works sections.

Revise your introduction and related works.
Add an outline of your methods section with a five to ten sentence outline while incorporating relevant information from your project updates. Relevant information includes the
software you are using,
datasets you are using,
tools you will use for analysis,
possible pitfalls,
etc.

## Related Works

Create a new web-page with the following information.

At least five related works (research, blog posts, videos, books, etc.).
At least two should be research articles
For each work, you should provide a one to three sentence summary.
With the related works, try to answer the question: what is the state-of-the-art in the domain of your project?

This is similar to an annotated bibliography, but I am not expecting you to write more than a few sentences for each entry.

Final reports will require more than one research articles, and you should plan on collecting/skimming additional related works throughout the semester.

You will submit a link to your web-page on gradescope.

## Discussion 

Although you probably will not have final results at this time, you should start outlining your discussion/results. Add a “discussion” section to your report web-page.

Revise your current text.
Add an outline of your discussion/results section.
Five to ten sentence outline
Think about:
what data you will present,
how you will interpret/evaluate your data,
how your work compare to others, and
how will you prove your point (support your claims).
You can also include explanations of important concepts that you have learned/implemented. Feel free to do this in a tutorial style.

For projects that are focused on an application or ethics discussion, you can tweak your discussion outline to match your topic.

Here is an example (and I've added comments in parentheses that would not be part of the submission):

## Reflection
