# Title: Summarizing articles from news 

## Project Description

Many people are too lazy to read articles and just want the latest catchup on news. Giving a quick gist of what the article is about (in less than 75 words or so), someone can distinguish whether they want to read further indepth or just ignore it. This way, it will save time and allow people to get on with their day quicker without having to scroll through the whole article finding the title itnersting, only to find the content absolutely boring. 

So, I will focus on training neural networks for the task of classifying what article is and what the gist of the article is. 


## Project Goals
1. Find data set that will have a list of articles and the summary of those articles
2. Train NN that is then able to "read/analyze" article and categorize and also summarize the news article
3. Also scrape current news articles to see if the NN created works.
