# Title: Summarizing articles from websites 

## Project Description

I will focus on training neural networks (NNs) for the task of summarizing articles. 

Data will come from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-category-dataset. 

## Project Goals

1. Create a dataset for training a NN for navigation.
2. Explore methods for adding "noise" to the dataset.
3. Train a NN that is able to navigate any procedurally generated maze.
